## Project Overview
**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this project is to predict future stock and index prices using machine learning models, generate live predictions, and evaluate performance using historical data. It is designed for traders, analysts, and data enthusiasts to gain actionable insights from financial data.

---

## Background
Stock market prediction is complex due to high volatility and non-linear patterns. Traditional statistical models often fail to capture these dynamics. This project leverages **machine learning** to forecast stock/index prices, providing a robust workflow from data collection to prediction and performance evaluation.

---

## Data Collection
- Source: **Yahoo Finance** via `yfinance`.
- Supports both historical and live stock/index data.
- Allows fetching daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.

---

## Preprocessing
- Converts all relevant columns to numeric format.
- Drops rows with missing `Close` values.
- Creates **technical indicators**:
  - **SMA20, SMA50, SMA200** â€“ Simple Moving Averages
  - **RSI** â€“ Relative Strength Index
  - **MACD & Signal Line** â€“ Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- Ensures data is ready for model input.

---

## Model Development
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained on historical price data and technical indicators to predict next-day prices.
- **Performance Report:** Compares predictions with actual historical prices.
- Designed to be extensible for **LSTM, GRU, CNN**, or ensemble models in the future.

---

## Model Training & Evaluation
- Performance evaluated using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.
- Fine-tuning of hyperparameters for better prediction accuracy.
- Generates visual plots of **predicted vs. actual values**.
- Supports both **historical backtesting** and **live prediction**.

---

## How It Works
1. **Live Prediction**  
   Fetches latest data from Yahoo Finance and predicts the next value using the trained model.

2. **Historical Performance Analysis**  
   Downloads historical data, generates features, runs the trained model, and outputs:
   - Predicted vs. actual prices
   - RMSE and other metrics
   - Visualization of prediction accuracy

3. **Visualization**  
   Generates plots to visualize trends and assess prediction performance.

## Programming Language & Libraries
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `yfinance` â€“ For stock data collection  
  - `pandas` & `numpy` â€“ Data processing  
  - `scikit-learn` â€“ Model building and evaluation  
  - `matplotlib` â€“ Visualization  
  - `joblib` â€“ Model serialization

---

## Challenges
- Handling **missing or inconsistent stock data**.
- Ensuring **feature engineering** works for both live and historical datasets.
- Avoiding **overfitting** in ML models.

---

## Future Work
- Integrate **deep learning models**: LSTM, GRU, CNN.
- Implement **multivariate time series forecasting**.
- Deploy a **web-based dashboard** for live monitoring.
- Combine multiple models for **ensemble forecasting**.
